        <b>Legislative Bills:</b>
        <p>
            A bill is a proposed law under consideration by a legislature. A bill does not become
            law until it is passed by the legislature and, in most cases, approved by the executive.
            Once a bill has been enacted into law, it is called an Act or a statute.</p>
